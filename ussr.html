<p> Shown through what has often been named by western scholars as propaganda, the Soviet Union’s own form of sharing visions of the future through printed media such as newspapers, magazines, posters, and books as well as cartoons and film/television.
One of such magazines dedicated to Soviet futurism among was Техника Молодежи, or Technology of The Youth/For Youth, which one could take as the technology to be inherited and developed by newer generations. 
</p> 
<p> Here we have an early post-war illustration in a softer version of Socialist realism, showing national pride through the use of a govermnet parade. We can also see flying cars in a similar design to helicopters as the main focus. We can infer from the Soviet Red Army's status in engineering and airspace war use how such depictions of tech advancments would spark an interests in the early mid-century.

    Here is a later image from a 1972 issue, dipicting a flying bus! What we can also see in the background is some more contemporary buildings, highlighting the development of city infustructer throughout the Soviet Union at the time.
</p>
<p> Aside from publications, independent artists’ visions were also spotlighted by the state and in citizen made culture.
One such artists was Gennady G. Golobokov, who was credited for creating psychological fiction in Soviet futurism. 
As a teenager Golobokov suffered from a spinal injury leaving him paralyzed, causing him to create his own process from his laying down position. This process  included light pressure strokes and erasings and painting the top pieces of his canvases upside down as he couldn’t reach them from the traditional perspective.

<p>As the Soviet Union’s system was based in socialism with the goal of eventual communism, and inorder to have communism run society would need to be considerate of our actions and enviornments and create a unity. We would see such ideas be expressed in their media with the message being uniformly fit in with such utopian ideals. 
</p>
<p>One such area was cartoons, one of the more famous ones being Тайна третьей планеты, or Mystery of the Third Planet. In this cartoon film we see space explorers of the twenty-second-century solve a mystery of a museum director causing the extinction of an already rare bird species and the malfunctioning of a robot community who would help the birds, all so that he can sell tickets to an exhibit about the birds. The main value of the story is to work for net value for science and society, and not for personal greed.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>
The Soviet Union took great pride in their advancements towards space travel. In fighting the United State in the space race, the Soviet Union would find a number of wins but also losses.

Notably, the first person to orbit was Yuri Gagarin. Before Gararin, the Soviets practiced with many dogs who lost their lives for humanity to understand how to survive the journey to and from outer space. Many people at the time and still now criticize the use of animal testing for a project that as an abstract is very unnecessary for human needs, but the soviets and other countries still carried on. Further, these dogs, the most famous of them and their images, were expressed to be heroes for humanity’s step forward to such imaginings of the future of space travel by their consentless sacrifices. 
</p>
<p>
Infamously was the tragic story of Laika. In 1958, Laika, the first dog in space unfortunately died due to overheating after about 6 hours in orbit that was originally planned to last a week. The launch was planned without an expected return on account of the spacecraft  missing proper landing construction and the scientist, Yazdovsky’s prelaunch final evening for Laika at his home with his children to offer kindness or comfort.

<p>
Another sad part to this story was that Mukha, pictured here, was almost picked to be the first dog to orbit, passing the same trials as Laika. But was reportedly not picked due to not being as photogenic for publicity.

<p>
Following Laika’s launch was Belka and Strelka who spent a day in space and came back home safely as the first beings brought back alive. Their survival stretch to now, both in leading a path towards human space travel and in national pride.

Themes of robots would tend to follow the idea that machinery could not replace humans, with some horror narratives of robots trying to but failing, especially as the century got closer to the 1980s and fears of artificial intelligence and robotic machinery development leading to career takeovers. 
More positive depictions of robots would be alike to that of friendly assistants, aids to humans rather than replacements, such as in the Mystery of the Third Planet, as see here a waiter robot with a "мену" or "menu" on it. The cartoon also featured a number of non human looking robots characterized as 'good robots,' while the only human-form robots - or humanoids - are presented as the 'evil-robots' as they were made to replace humans.

<p>
    Interestingly, some robot representations of being visually human became more popular in the drama or horror genre. One I remember from my childhood was 1979’s The Adventures of Elektronik, or Приключения Электроника, where a boy, Sergey, uses a robot double, Elektronik, as a replacement for doing his homework and chores only to realize he's replacing himself and doesn't like the longterm implications.
</p>
<p>Fun fact! The term “robot” comes from the slavik word “работа” (ra-bot-a), which means “work.” Although first coined by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek in 1922, where it more specifically means “forced labor.”</p>
