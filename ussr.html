<h5>In Art</h5>
<p>Shown through what has often been named by western scholars as propaganda, the Soviet Union’s own form of sharing visions of the future through printed media such as newspapers, magazines, posters, and books as well as cartoons and film/television.
One of such magazines dedicated to Soviet futurism among was Техника Молодежи, or Technology of The Youth/For Youth, which one could take as the technology to be inherited and developed by newer generations. 
</p>
<h5>In Values</h5>
<p>Info here</p>
<p>Such art styles used would be socialist realism and soviet style cartoons, however independent artists’ visions were also spotlighted by the state and in citizen made culture.
One such artists was Gennady G. Golobokov, who was credited for creating psychological fiction in Soviet futurism. 
As a teenager Golobokov suffered from a spinal injury leaving him paralyzed, causing him to create his own process from his laying down position. This process  included light pressure strokes and erasings and painting the top pieces of his canvases upside down as he couldn’t reach them from the traditional perspective.
</p>
<p>Here are some of Golobokov’s art depicting future technology and life. 
</p>
<p>Soviet architecture would evolve to fill the futuristic visuals and goals, notably in the constructivist and brutalist styles that often showed uniformity and smooth shapes in exterior design.

<h5>In Technology</h5>
<p>The Soviet Union took great pride in their advancements towards space travel. Add in some details of the space race and stories here
</p>
<p>Notably, the first person to orbit was Yuri Gagarin. Add info here about Laika, Belka, and Strelka.

    Infamously was the tragic story of Laika. In 1958, Laika, the first dog in space unfortunately died due to overheating after about 6 hours in orbit that was originally planned to last a week. The launch was planned without an expected return on account of the spacecraft  missing proper landing construction and the scientist, Yazdovsky’s prelaunch final evening for Laika at his home with his children to offer kindness or comfort for her.

    Another sad part to this story was that Mukha, pictured here, was almost picked to be the first dog to orbit, passing the same trials as Laika. But was reportedly not picked due to not being as photogenic for publicity.</p>
<p>Following Laika’s launch was Belka and Strelka who spent a day in space and came back home safely as the first beings brought back alive. Their survival stretch to now, both in leading a path towards human space travel and in culture  as there is a Russian cartoon with their caricatures as leads.
