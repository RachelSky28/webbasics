<h2>Cold War Futurism</h2>
<p> Notably, freedom to express imaginings of the future contrasted largely due to media control.
Soviet media was heavily overlooked by the governing party, giving an influence to the public of more positive imagining. 
While the media was largely controlled in the United States under the initial wave of McCarthyism, artists were given more liberty to express narratives for public view. As the century progressed, more critical narratives of imagined dystopias would fill American pop culture through the allowed freedom of expression via publications and studios.</p>
