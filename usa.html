<h5>In Art</h5>
<p>
In public media, we have American futurism shown in printed media such as magazine articles, comics, and advertisements, as well as cartoons and film/television. What we now call retrofuturism is how we can understand visions of the future from mid-century America.
</p>
<p>
Fashion in American futurism has varied throughout the mid-century, going from copy pasting present fashion, to adding such sharp embellishments, to giving simplistic designs, to even reversing fashion as in the 1970s film, Logan’s Run where we have a mix of simplistic but also roman-esc style.   
</p>
    <h5>In Values</h5>
<p>
As the United States of America’s economic structure is based in a capitalist system, expressions of futuristic ideas would vary from expressed experiences of middle-upper class lifestyles and criticisms of class divide (economic, racial, gender, and age) and environmental impacts. 
In part, much of American visions of the future was built by advertisers creating a hope for a future of consumerism

    Here is an example of an earlier form of such mid-century visions of prosperity rooted in consumerism called "Mankind's Major Struggle Will Be Against Boredom," from the Life Magazine's December 1959 magazine. Such ideals of what a future in capitalism would be involved the thought that eventually people would work less, earn more, and buy more with such extra cash and the boom of, not just tech advancements, but such advancements as market items as companies are free to produce in the market economy. Of course such frivolous consumption based ideals would soon spark concerns of production costs for the enviornment. This specific comic depicts a future set in 1975, when such criticms would become common discourse in media and activism. Flashing forward to today in the 2020s, we see how such ideals only came with growing issues for the enviorment, worker's rights, and a growing class divide as this specific experience of capitalism has grown out from such values in visions.

<p>
We’ll see more dystopian images of the future depicted in the science fiction film genre as critiques on the system’s negative effects on the environment, experienced class divisions, and social responsibility of the government.
Such notable depictions of futurist visions would be in the 1971 film "Silent Running," where in a time when all botanical life on earth has been extinct, a commercial spaceship would have to destroy their greenhouse inorder to make room for more cargo. Another would be the 1973 film, "Soylent Green," which's narrative follows how the year 2022 isn’t depicted for the larger lower class as being as the idealized futuristic style as by the depicted upper class.

<h5>In Technology</h5>
<p> 
    <img src="mrsmith.jpg" alt="Page from Mr.Venus" 
    style= "float:left;width:40%;max-width:100%;300px;margin: 10px;">
    Here we see a piece from the March 1950 article, Mr Smith Goes to Venus, depicting travel to other planets alike to that of an airplane flight or cruise travel. We'll see more space flight and space life depictions grow through the science-fiction genre, notably Starwars and Star Trek.
</p>
<p> Aside from space travel in media, we see such visions give life applications through reallife missions to develop space travel. the 1950s through the 1960s would be the height of the space race against the Soviet Union, where The United States would often fall short in many way, yet sometimes not, and would take lessons from the Soviet Union's successes and failures.

<p>
Notably the first animals in space were fruit flies sent by the United States in February 1957, ten years before the Soviet Union sent Laika the dog in November 1967.
The United States would then in 1969 send the first people to walk the moon, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

<p>Of robots, early on many were depicted to look alike to home technology and to serve the role as service bots in earlier forms, as in the robot maid, Rosey, from the cartoon The Jetsons</p>
