<h5>In Art</h5>
<p>In public media, we have American futurism shown in printed media such as magazine articles, comics, and advertisements, as well as cartoons and film/television. What we now call retrofuturism is how we can understand visions of the future from mid-century America.</p>
<h5>In Values</h5>
<p>As the United States of America’s economic structure is based in a capitalist system, expressions of futuristic ideas would vary from expressed experiences of middle-upper class lifestyles and criticisms of class divide (economic, racial, gender, and age) and environmental impacts.</p>
<h5>In Technology</h5>

    Here we see a piece from the March 1950 article, Mr Smith Goes to Venus, depicting travel to other planets alike to that of an airplane flight or cruise travel.

<p>Notably the first animals in space were fruit flies sent by the United States in February 1957, ten years before the Soviet Union sent Laika the dog in November 1967.
The United States would then in 1969 send the first people to walk the moon. 
</p>
<p>Of robots, many were depicted to look alike to home technology and to serve the role as service bots in earlier forms, as in the robot maid, Rosey, from the cartoon The Jetsons</p>
